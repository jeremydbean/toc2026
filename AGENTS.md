# Agent Instructions For Times of Chaos

These instructions apply to automated coding work in this repository. Use the
source code, tests, and maintained guides as authority. Historical notes and old
wiki format pages are context, not proof of current behavior.

## Project Identity

- Repository: `jeremydbean/toc2026`
- Runtime: legacy single-process C MUD based on Diku/Merc/ROM
- World data: Latin-1 `.are` files loaded from `area/area.lst`
- Dashboard: FastAPI/Uvicorn in `webadmin/`
- Primary Make output: repository-root `merc`
- CMake output: repository-root `bin/rom`
- Game working directory: `area/`
- Default game/dashboard ports: `9000` and `9001`

Maintained documentation:

- `README.md`: project front door and quick starts
- `wiki/player-guide.md`: player progression and systems
- `wiki/player-command-reference.md`: player command map
- `wiki/hosting-guide.md`: deployment/configuration/persistence
- `wiki/operator-guide.md`: immortal and incident procedures
- `wiki/developer-guide.md`: architecture and development workflow
- `wiki/area-building-guide.md`: authoritative area format reference
- `wiki/validation-and-area-health.md`: validators and issue codes
- `wiki/hyrule-area.md`: generated Hyrule design and workflow
- `SECURITY.md`: actual security boundaries and hardening
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`: review checklist

## Non-Negotiable Data Safety

- Do not modify anything under `player/` or `gods/` without explicit user
  permission for the exact files and purpose.
- Treat `heroes/`, `backups/`, `.env`, logs, and player snapshots as sensitive.
- Never use a real character file as a test fixture.
- Do not expose or commit password hashes, admin tokens, private logs, IP data,
  or other player information.
- Do not modify archived `area/korzath2old.are` or
  `area/savedTrinidad.are` as active world content.
- Do not silently convert `.are` files to UTF-8. They are Latin-1 and contain
  `~`-terminated strings.
- Do not hand-edit generated Hyrule output for a lasting change. Update
  `data/hyrule_first_quest.json` and/or the generator, regenerate, and test.
- Work with existing uncommitted user changes. Never discard, reset, or rewrite
  unrelated work.

## Start Every Task With Context

1. Read `git status --short --branch`.
2. Inspect relevant code, declarations, tests, help, and documentation before
   deciding on an implementation.
3. Use `rg`/`rg --files` for search.
4. Trace cross-module contracts: command table, declarations, persistence,
   help, area data, parser, API, and tests.
5. Prefer established repository patterns over a new abstraction.
6. Keep scope narrow and preserve unusual behavior unless the task explicitly
   changes it.

Do not stop at a proposed fix when the user asked for implementation. Carry the
change through verification and a clear result.

## Build And Run

Primary Linux/macOS build:

```bash
make clean
make
cd area
../merc --check-area
../merc 9000
```

The Make build uses GNU89 compatibility, `-fcommon`, ROM definitions, and
`libcrypt`/`libm` where applicable.

CMake:

```bash
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build
cd area
../bin/rom --check-area
```

Sanitizers:

```bash
cmake -S . -B build-sanitize \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug \
  -DENABLE_SANITIZERS=ON
cmake --build build-sanitize
```

Supported long-running native wrapper:

```bash
./startup.sh 9000
```

The root compatibility file named `startup` and `area/startup.sh` delegate to
the maintained root `startup.sh`. Files under `zStartup/` are archived history
and must not be used as current launchers.

Docker:

```bash
docker compose up --build -d
docker compose logs -f game
docker compose stop
```

Docker Compose publishes ports 9000 and 9001 on all interfaces by default and
uses `restart: unless-stopped`. Production documentation must tell hosts to
restrict port 9001 and use `docker compose stop` when the container must remain
off.

## Validation

Full Linux/macOS/CI suite:

```bash
bash scripts/validate.sh
```

Full Windows PowerShell suite (requires WSL):

```powershell
.\scripts\validate.ps1
.\scripts\validate.ps1 -RunSmoke
```

Focused checks:

```bash
make
cd area && ../merc --check-area && cd ..
python3 check_parser.py
python3 check_exits.py
python3 check_resets.py
python3 check_shops.py
python3 scripts/area_lint.py --fail-on critical --limit 100
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests
git diff --check
```

Current August 2026 Python baseline:

```text
99 listed area entries
2,336 mobiles
3,551 objects
7,781 rooms
0 critical, 11 warning, 1,565 information findings
```

Six list entries are help/social files without `#AREA`; native boot creates one
online-building area. Do not force native and Python area totals to match by
removing valid files or hiding the generated area.

Run tests proportional to risk. Movement, combat, extraction, persistence,
world loading, command authorization, and queue changes need the full suite plus
manual gameplay checks.

## C Change Rules

- Match surrounding GNU89-compatible style even though CMake also compiles as
  C17.
- Add new source files to `CMakeLists.txt`; Make globs `src/*.c`, CMake does not.
- Add declarations in the established header and avoid implicit declarations.
- Use `snprintf`, `toc_strlcpy`, and `toc_strlcat` with the true destination
  size. Do not add `sprintf`, `strcpy`, or unbounded `strcat`.
- Use `UNUSED_PARAM(x)` for intentionally unused parameters.
- Preserve game output line endings (`\n\r`).
- Validate player-controlled numbers before conversion, multiplication, loops,
  indexing, allocation, or narrowing.
- Revalidate pointers after calls that can kill, extract, move, or free a
  character/object.
- Restore temporary room pointers, global movement flags, and iterator state on
  every return path.
- Preserve command-table order semantics. Prefix matching can make an earlier
  entry win.
- Password-bearing commands must not be logged.
- Keep persisted enum/flag/slot/vnum values stable unless a migration is part of
  the task.

## Player-Facing Bug Review

For each changed command or gameplay path, check:

- missing, malformed, negative, zero, huge, and overflow input
- abbreviations and case handling
- unavailable skill/class/guild/race/level
- sleeping/resting/fighting/dead state
- NPC, charmed, switched, grouped, mounted, PK, and immortal variants
- closed/hidden/one-way/self-loop exits and all ten directions
- traps or scripts that kill/extract/move during a command
- target/item disappearance during combat or trigger callbacks
- duplicate/lost items, currency, experience, quest credit, or corpse ownership
- early returns that leave global state or room pointers changed
- save/reload behavior and old player files
- help text and actual behavior agreement

Do not label deliberate random recall as a bug. It can choose any room that is
eligible and not protected. Some areas, including Hyrule, intentionally disable
recall and provide explicit return paths.

## Area Work

The authoritative reference is `wiki/area-building-guide.md`.

- Parse sections structurally; do not use unbounded global text replacement.
- Keep vnums globally unique within each indexed type.
- Ensure positive exit targets exist.
- Validate reset context and references.
- Review one-way exits, disconnected groups, unspawned definitions, source-less
  objects, traps, teleports, portals, pet storage, and restricted rooms.
- Add active files to `area/area.lst` in the intended load order.
- Run native and Python validation after every area change.
- Explain intentional warning/info findings with evidence instead of adding a
  silent allowlist.

Hyrule workflow:

```bash
make hyrule-area
make test-hyrule
python3 check_exits.py
python3 check_resets.py
python3 scripts/area_lint.py --fail-on critical --limit 100
```

## Dashboard Work

- The C server is authoritative. Dashboard parser reload is dashboard-only.
- Protected routes use `WEB_ADMIN_TOKEN` in `X-Admin-Token`; an unset token
  disables them with 503.
- `/ws/logs` currently receives the token in a query parameter.
- Read routes including player list/detail and `/ws` are public at the app layer.
  Do not claim the token protects the entire dashboard.
- Treat queue writing as immortal command execution.
- Bound payloads and result limits; reject newlines/control data that can split
  queue records.
- Preserve the last known-good parser when reload validation fails.
- Add tests for no/wrong/correct token, malformed bodies, boundaries,
  filesystem races, and failed parser reload.
- Document authentication status for every new route.

## Security Facts

- Game transport is plain Telnet.
- Supported player password files use traditional DES `crypt` hashes.
- Only the first eight password bytes are effective.
- Player files and backups must be treated as exposed credentials if stolen.
- The dashboard should be loopback/private even with a token.
- Do not provide offensive password-cracking automation from repository data.
  Defensive verification must use explicit authorization and sanitized inputs.

See `SECURITY.md` for mitigation and reporting procedures.

## Documentation Rules

- Keep `README.md` concise and route detail to focused guides.
- Update in-game help for player-visible syntax/behavior.
- Make commands runnable from the directory stated above them.
- Separate defaults, current measured baselines, and design guarantees.
- Recalculate world totals after `area.lst` or generated-world changes.
- Preserve historical format pages, but mark the modern area guide as
  authoritative.
- Correct stale instructions when source behavior changes.
- Use ASCII for new documentation unless an existing file requires otherwise.

## Git And Delivery

- Inspect status and diffs before editing and before final delivery.
- Never reset, discard, or overwrite unrelated user changes.
- Keep generated source/output changes together.
- Run `git diff --check`.
- Do not stage, commit, push, merge, or open a pull request unless the user has
  explicitly authorized that action for the current task.
- When publishing is authorized, use a focused branch/review flow and report the
  exact validation result.

## Completion Standard

A task is complete only when the requested behavior or documentation is
implemented, relevant tests pass, the diff is reviewed, and any limitation or
unrun test is reported. Do not leave required long-running test/server sessions
unattended at final response.
